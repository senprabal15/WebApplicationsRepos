# Journal Mood Analyzer

This is a simple, interactive Angular web application for tracking daily journal entries with mood and time logging.

## Features
- Add daily journal entries
- Select your mood (emoji or color)
- Log the time of each entry
- View a timeline/list of past entries

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
3. Open your browser at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

## Project Structure
- `src/app/` - Main application code
- `src/app/components/` - UI components (to be created)
- `src/app/models/` - Data models (to be created)

## Customization
Feel free to extend the app with authentication, backend integration, or analytics.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
